### Proposed Project Description  

**People around the world are used to chatting online about everything, including discussing the latest episode with a friend, organizing a team-building meeting, or asking your favorite coffee shop’s chatbot about new flavors. 
Numbers and statistics are also on the side of chat apps. The overwhelming majority of studies show that instant messaging is becoming more and more popular among users worldwide.
We will be using express to build the web server that Socket.IO will work with. Any other node-server-side framework or even node HTTP server can be used. Express JS makes it easy to define routes and other things. Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on the browser, focusing equally on reliability and speed. Socket.IO is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js. It is one of the most dependent upon the library on npm (Node Package Manager). The chat server’s resources can include a REST API, a WebSocket server, MongoDB Atlas for media storage and cloud platform, etc.**
